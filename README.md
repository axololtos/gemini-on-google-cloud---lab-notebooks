google-cloud-gemini-labs

this repo contains my jupyter notebooks from completing a series of google cloud skill badge labs focused on gemini and its multimodal capabilities. it's all about getting hands-on with generative ai on vertex ai.


labs covered üöÄ
here are the notebooks you'll find in this repo:

GSP1210 - Multimodality with Gemini: the basic intro lab. covers how to use text, image, and video prompts with the gemini api to analyze content.

GSP1230 - Using Gemini for Multimodal Retail Recommendations: a practical lab on building a retail recommendation system that can "see" a room and suggest matching furniture from a catalog of images.

GSP1231 - Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): a more advanced lab on using rag to ask questions about complex documents that contain both text and images (like financial reports).

GSP520 - Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini: Challenge Lab: the final challenge. this one tests all the skills from the previous labs in a real-world scenario without step-by-step instructions.



how to use
these notebooks are my personal solutions and walkthroughs for the labs. you can use them as a reference if you're taking the labs yourself. to run them, you'll need access to a google cloud project with vertex ai workbench enabled. just upload the notebook and run the cells.
